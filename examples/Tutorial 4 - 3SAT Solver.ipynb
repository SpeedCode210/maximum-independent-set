    "The general idea is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to convert an instance of 3SAT into a graph in which if a node is part of a MIS solution, it MUST be true (note that a node that is not part of a MIS solution may or may not be true, we don't care, as it does not contribute to the result)\n",
    "every term is compiled into a node in our graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since X and NOT X cannot be both true simultaneously, if there is a term X and a term NOT X, we connect their representations in our graph, to make sure that both of them cannot appear simultaneously in a solution to MIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- In every clause, we connect the three nodes in the graph, to make sure that only one of them MUST be true (This bounds the maximum number of nodes to the number of clauses)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once we have a MIS solution, we only need to confirm that one node in each clause is part of the MIS solution, i.e. we only need to check the length of the MIS solution (Since the maximum number of nodes is the number of clauses, and that in each triangle representing a clause we can have at most one node, reaching a configuration with exactly the good number of nodes implies that the solution is valid).\n"
